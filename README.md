# Magic-Game
 A magic game I worked on for a while

The game includes lots of self-made RPG systems, including:

A magic system with several different spells, using polymorphism to categorize each spell

An inventory simliar, with the ability to pick up items, place down items, and organize the iventory (press I)

A fluid moving and flying system

Simple AI for monsters with an aggression range

Health bars above players head, interactable characters

Basic animations and many self-modeled assets

A levitation system that feels really smooth to use.

Other basic RPG mechanics

-------------------

The game right now is mostly just testing stuff, but the code and functionality is there.
